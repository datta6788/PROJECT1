# Anime Recommendation System

A machine learning-powered Anime Recommendation System that combines Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering into a Hybrid Recommendation Engine. The system recommends anime based on similarities in content, user preferences, and a weighted hybrid approach. Built using Python, Scikit-Learn, Streamlit, and the Jikan API.

---

## Features

### Content-Based Filtering

Recommends anime based on similarities in genres, themes, and descriptions using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.

### Collaborative Filtering

Uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) on user-anime rating data to identify anime preferred by users with similar viewing patterns.

### Hybrid Recommendation System

Combines content-based and collaborative recommendations using weighted scoring to provide more balanced and accurate recommendations.

### Fuzzy Search

Handles spelling mistakes and partial anime names using RapidFuzz.

### Anime Metadata Integration

Fetches anime posters, ratings, episode counts, and genres using the Jikan API.

### Interactive Web Application

Built with Streamlit for an easy-to-use and responsive interface.
